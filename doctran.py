Dear Mustang Motors Team,

I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent car purchase (Mustang GT). Regrettably, the car hasn't lived up to my expectations, and I would like to request a refund.

The car's functionality and performance have not matched the quality advertised through your marketing initiatives and previous customer testimonials. The innovative design and features, as touted by your R&D department, seem inconsistent with the actual vehicle.

Could you please guide me through the refund process? I trust in your ability to resolve this issue promptly and satisfactorily.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Max MÃ¼ller
